Thanks for visiting! The Weinberger Lab at Yale School of Public Health conducts interdisiplinary research on the epidemiology and biology of respiratory tract infections. YSPH is a great environment for doing infectious disease research.  We are co-housed in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases and the inter-departmental Public Health Modeling Unit.  

Our favorite pathogens are:

1. **Pneumococcus!** This is Dan's first love in epidemiology. He started working on it in 2005 and can't escape from its sugary grasp. Pneumococcus is super interesting, both from a biological standpoint and from a vaccine response standpoint. We have active projects modeling how the pneumococcal population changes following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), we develop and use novel statistical tools to quantify the impact of PCVs in different populations worldwide, and we are doign experimental work to undestand the barriers and pathways to capsule switching. Together with Anne Wyllie, we are also looking at the transmission of pneumococcus among older adults in the community (real field work!). And we also lead the surveillance for non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in Connecticut, in collaboration with Connecticut DPH/Emerging Infection program and led by Stephanie Perniciaro.  These projects are supported by grants from the NIH, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Pfizer, Merck, and CDC/CT DPH.

2. **Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).** It turns out that if you are infected with influenza or RSV, you are more likely to get severe pneumococcal disease. This triggered a series of analyses trying to quantify the interaction between these pathogens. More recently, we (in close collaboration with Dr. Ginny Pitzer and Dr. Josh Warren) have been working to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of RSV and the implications of this for vaccination and prophylaxis. And we are working to consider how clinical trials for RSV could be more optimally designed to incporporate information from multiple endpoints.  

3. **Legionella**: Kelsie Cassell got really interested in *Legionella* when she was doing her masters and somehow roped the rest of the group into it. We collaborate with the Connecticut DPH

4. **SARS-CoV-2**: Ugh. Yes, like everyone else, we have spent a lot of time working on COVID-19. We've done a lot of work quantifying excess deaths in different populations. We wrote an R package to facilitate analysis of data from syndromic surveillance systems early on in the pandemic (now in use in a smattering of health departments and organizations). And we contributed to work on sewage sampling for SARS-CoV-2, work evaluating the impact of viral testing in nursing homes, and work on pooling strategies when testing clinical samples. We have ongoing work on the impact of COVID-related disruptions on various pathogens and on the effectiveness of COVID vaccines in certain high-risk populations  

**Collaborations** We collaborate widely, including with investigators from the Pan American Health Organization, CDC/Atlanta, CDC/Kenya, MRC Gambia, UMC Utrecht, RIVM, NICD/S Africa, Statens Serum Institut, and The Connecticut Emerging Infection program. We love to host people at Yale who come with datasets and a question.
